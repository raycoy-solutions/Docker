Challenge:

Imagine that you want to deploy a PHP welcome page that will greet visitors based on the date and time using the following logic.
Your task is to dockerize the PHP application provided by the developer.
Use Apache web server installed on an Ubuntu base image


<?php
    $hourOfDay = date('H');
    if($hourOfDay < 12) {
        $message = "Good Morning";
    } elseif($hourOfDay > 11 && $hourOfDay < 18) {
        $message = "Good Afternoon";
    } elseif($hourOfDay > 17){
        $message = "Good Evening";
    }
    echo $message;
?>

Hint:
    1. Create a directory and change into the directory
    2. Create a welcome.php with code provided
    3. Create a Dockerfile and set up the application with PHP and Apache2 on Ubuntu base image
    4. Build and run the Docker image
