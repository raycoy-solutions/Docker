## Define your own bridge network


	(1) List current networks before you do anything else
		
		docker network ls

	(1b) Create the alpine-net network

		docker network create --driver bridge raycoy-net

		docker network create raycoy-net

		docker network ls


	
	(2) Start two alpine containers running ash
		
		docker run -dit --name alpine1 alpine ash

		docker run -dit --name alpine2 alpine ash

		docker container ls



	(3) Inspect the bridge network to see what containers are connected to it
		
		docker network inspect raycoy-net

		- Confirm no containers yet
	
	
	(3b) Create three (3) containers with the network you just created (--network):

		docker run -dit --name alpine1 --network alpine-net alpine ash

 		docker run -dit --name alpine2 --network alpine-net alpine ash

 		docker run -dit --name alpine3 alpine ash



	(3c) Inspect the raycoy-net network again

		docker network inspect raycoy-net



	(4) Attach to the containers running in the background. 
		
		docker container attach alpine1


	(5) From within alpine1, make sure you can connect to the internet by pinging google.com

		ping -c 2 google.com


	(6) Try to ping the second container by its IP address 172.17.0.3
		
		ping -c 2 172.17.0.3


	(6b) Try to ping the third container by its IP address 172.17.0.3
		
		ping -c 2 172.17.0.4



	(7) Try to ping the alpine2 container by container name

		ping -c 2 alpine2

		ping -c 2 alpine3



	(8) Stop and remove containers

		docker container stop alpine1 alpine2
		docker container rm alpine1 alpine2
