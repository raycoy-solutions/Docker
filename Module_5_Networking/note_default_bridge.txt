## Use the default bridge network

	(1) List current networks before you do anything else
		
		docker network ls
	
	(2) Start two alpine containers running ash
		
		docker run -dit --name alpine1 alpine ash

		docker run -dit --name alpine2 alpine ash

		
		docker container ls


	(3) Inspect the bridge network to see what containers are connected to it
		
		docker network inspect bridge

		- Confirm the containers are connected to the same network
		- Note the IPAddress of the containers

	(4) Attach to the containers running in the background. 
		
		docker attach alpine1

	(5) From within alpine1, make sure you can connect to the internet by pinging google.com

		ping -c 2 google.com

	(6) Try to ping the second container by its IP address 172.17.0.3
		
		ping -c 2 172.17.0.3

	(7) Try to ping the alpine2 container by container name

		ping -c 2 alpine2


	(8) Stop and remove containers

		docker container stop alpine1 alpine2
		docker container rm alpine1 alpine2
