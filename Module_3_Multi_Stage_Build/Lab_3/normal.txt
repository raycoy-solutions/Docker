Task
    Your manager has asked you to dockerize a simple Golang application. 
    You are provided with the Golang source code file, and your task is to compile and run this file. 
    In this lab, you will build a Docker image using the normal build process. 
    You will then observe the image size of the final Docker image

Solution:
    1. Create a new directory named normal-build and navigate to the newly created directory:
        mkdir normal-build && normal-build

    2. Create a file named welcome.go
        touch welcome.go
    
    3. Open the welcome.go file using your favorite text editor:
        vi welcome.go

    4. Add the following content to the welcome.go file, save it, and exit from the welcome.go file:

            package main

            import "fmt"
            func main() {
                fmt.Println("Welcome to multi-stage Docker builds")
            }

    5. Create a file named Dockerfile
        touch Dockerfile

    6. Add the following content to the Dockerfile

        FROM golang:latest
        WORKDIR /myapp
        COPY welcome.go .
        RUN go build -o welcome .
        ENTRYPOINT ["./welcome"]

    7. docker build -t welcome:v1 .

    8. docker image ls

    9. Check the image size
